## calculator.py
### Overview
The `calculator.py` file contains a collection of mathematical functions that can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Functions

#### add(a, b)
##### Description
The `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be added.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be added.
##### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Outputs: 8
```

#### sub(c, d)
##### Description
The `sub` function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.
##### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to be subtracted from the first.
##### Returns
The difference between `c` and `d`.
##### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Outputs: 6
```

#### mul(a, b)
##### Description
The `mul` function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be multiplied.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be multiplied.
##### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = mul(7, 2)
print(result)  # Outputs: 14
```

### Execution Flow
Since `calculator.py` contains multiple functions, the execution flow can be visualized as follows:

    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
This flowchart illustrates the possible execution paths for the functions in `calculator.py`. Note that the functions are independent of each other and can be called separately.

### Module-Level Code
When run directly, `calculator.py` does not contain any module-level code that performs a specific task. The functions provided in this file are intended to be imported and used in other scripts or applications.
