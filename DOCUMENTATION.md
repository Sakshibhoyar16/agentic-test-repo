## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a collection of mathematical functions. 

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to add.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to add.

#### Returns
* The sum of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 12
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

#### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to subtract from the first.

#### Returns
* The difference between `c` and `d`.

#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to multiply.

#### Returns
* The product of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = mul(6, 9)
print(result)  # Output: 54
```

Since the calculator.py file has more than one function, here is a flowchart showing the execution flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

When run directly, this script does not have any specific execution flow or output, as it only defines functions without a main block. To use these functions, you would need to call them explicitly in your code.
