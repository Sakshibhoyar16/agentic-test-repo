# API Documentation

## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a set of mathematical functions that can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Functions
#### add(a, b)
##### Description
The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to add.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to add.
##### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

#### sub(c, d)
##### Description
The `sub` function calculates the difference between two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to subtract.
##### Returns
The difference between `c` and `d`.
##### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

#### mul(a, b)
##### Description
The `mul` function calculates the product of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to multiply.
##### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = mul(5, 6)
print(result)  # Output: 30
```

### Execution Flow
Since there are multiple functions in this file, the following Mermaid flowchart illustrates the execution flow:

    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E

```
Note: The actual execution flow may vary depending on how the functions are called and used in the program. This flowchart is a simplified representation of the possible execution paths.

### Module-Level Code
When run directly, this script does not contain any module-level code, such as print statements or a main block, that would execute when the script is run as the main program. The functions can be imported and used in other scripts as needed.
