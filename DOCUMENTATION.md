This file provides basic arithmetic operations.

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be added.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be added.

#### Returns
* `result` (int or float): The sum of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

#### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to be subtracted from the first.

#### Returns
* `result` (int or float): The difference between `c` and `d`.

#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be multiplied.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be multiplied.

#### Returns
* `result` (int or float): The product of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = mul(7, 2)
print(result)  # Output: 14
```

Since this file has more than one function, the following flowchart illustrates the execution flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note: This flowchart shows that the execution can start with any of the three functions (`add`, `sub`, `mul`) and then ends. 

There are no classes or variables defined in this file. When run directly, this script does not have a main block to execute, so no description is provided for module-level code.
