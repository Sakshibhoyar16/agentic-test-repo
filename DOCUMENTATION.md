## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a set of mathematical functions that can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to add.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to add.

#### Returns
* The sum of `a` and `b` (int or float).

#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 12
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

#### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to subtract from the first.

#### Returns
* The difference between `c` and `d` (int or float).

#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to multiply.

#### Returns
* The product of `a` and `b` (int or float).

#### Example
```python
result = mul(5, 6)
print(result)  # Output: 30
```

Since there are multiple functions in this file, the following flowchart illustrates the execution flow:

    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E

```
Note: This flowchart is a simple representation of the possible execution paths and does not reflect any specific control flow logic that may be present in the code. 

There are no classes or variables defined in this file. 

When run directly, this script does not contain any module-level code (e.g., print statements, main blocks) that would execute. It is intended to be imported and used as a module.
