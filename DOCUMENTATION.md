## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a collection of mathematical functions.

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to add.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to add.

#### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The sum of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Outputs: 8
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

#### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to subtract from the first.

#### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The difference between `c` and `d`.

#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Outputs: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to multiply.

#### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The product of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = mul(7, 2)
print(result)  # Outputs: 14
```

Since this file contains more than one function, the execution flow can be represented as follows:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note that the execution flow is not necessarily sequential, as these functions can be called independently. This flowchart simply illustrates the possible entry points into the calculator.py module. 

When run directly, this script does not have a main block or any print statements, so it does not perform any actions on its own. It is intended to be imported as a module and used by other scripts.
