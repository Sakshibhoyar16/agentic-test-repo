## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a collection of mathematical functions. 

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `a` (number): The first number to add.
* `b` (number): The second number to add.
#### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.
#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Outputs: 12
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function calculates the difference between two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `c` (number): The first number.
* `d` (number): The second number to subtract from the first.
#### Returns
The difference between `c` and `d`.
#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Outputs: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function calculates the product of two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `a` (number): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (number): The second number to multiply.
#### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.
#### Example
```python
result = mul(5, 6)
print(result)  # Outputs: 30
```

Since there are multiple functions in this file, the following flowchart illustrates the execution flow:
```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note that the flowchart shows the possible execution paths for each function, but does not imply a specific order of execution. The actual execution flow will depend on how these functions are called in the code.
