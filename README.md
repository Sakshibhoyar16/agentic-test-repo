### Functions
#### add(a, b)
##### Description
The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `a` (number): The first number to add.
* `b` (number): The second number to add.
##### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

#### sub(c, d)
##### Description
The `sub` function calculates the difference of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `c` (number): The first number.
* `d` (number): The second number to subtract from the first.
##### Returns
The difference of `c` and `d`.
##### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

#### mul(a, b)
##### Description
The `mul` function calculates the product of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `a` (number): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (number): The second number to multiply.
##### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = mul(5, 6)
print(result)  # Output: 30
```

### Execution Flow
Since there are multiple functions in this file, here's a high-level overview of the execution flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note that the actual execution flow depends on how these functions are called in the application. This flowchart shows that the program can start with any of the three functions and end after their execution. 

### Module-Level Code
When run directly, this script does not have any module-level code that executes. The functions `add`, `sub`, and `mul` can be imported and used in other scripts.
