## calculator.py
The `calculator.py` file contains a set of mathematical functions to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to add.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to add.
#### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.
#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Outputs: 12
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function calculates the difference between two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to subtract from the first.
#### Returns
The difference between `c` and `d`.
#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Outputs: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function calculates the product of two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to multiply.
#### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.
#### Example
```python
result = mul(6, 9)
print(result)  # Outputs: 54
```

Since `calculator.py` contains more than one function, the execution flow can be represented as follows:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note: The flowchart shows that the execution flow starts at the beginning of the script and can proceed to any of the three functions (`add`, `sub`, or `mul`) before ending. 

There are no classes or variables defined in this file, and no module-level code is present outside of the functions.
