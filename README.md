## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a collection of mathematical functions that can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be added.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be added.

#### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Outputs: 8
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function calculates the difference between two numbers.

#### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to be subtracted.

#### Returns
The difference between `c` and `d`.

#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Outputs: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function calculates the product of two numbers.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be multiplied.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be multiplied.

#### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = mul(5, 6)
print(result)  # Outputs: 30
```

Since there are multiple functions in this file, a flowchart is included to illustrate the execution flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note: This flowchart assumes that the functions are called independently, and the execution flow may vary depending on the actual usage of these functions in a larger program. 

When run directly, this script does not contain any module-level code, so there is no description to provide for that scenario. 

There are no classes or variables in this file to document.
