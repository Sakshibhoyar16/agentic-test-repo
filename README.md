## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a set of basic arithmetic functions.

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be added.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be added.

#### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The sum of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

#### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to be subtracted from the first.

#### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The difference between `c` and `d`.

#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.

#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be multiplied.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be multiplied.

#### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The product of `a` and `b`.

#### Example
```python
result = mul(5, 6)
print(result)  # Output: 30
```

Since there are multiple functions in this file, here is a Mermaid flowchart showing the execution flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note: This flowchart assumes that each function can be called independently from the start. In a real-world scenario, the execution flow may depend on the specific use case and how these functions are used together. 

There are no classes or variables to document in this file. 

When run directly, this script does not have a main block or any print statements, so it does not perform any specific action. It is intended to be imported as a module and used by other scripts.
