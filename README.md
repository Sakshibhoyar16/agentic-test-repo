### Functions
#### add(a, b)
##### Description
The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to add.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to add.
##### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Outputs: 12
```
#### sub(c, d)
##### Description
The `sub` function calculates the difference of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to subtract.
##### Returns
The difference of `c` and `d`.
##### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Outputs: 6
```
#### mul(a, b)
##### Description
The `mul` function calculates the product of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to multiply.
##### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = mul(3, 9)
print(result)  # Outputs: 27
```
### Execution Flow
Since there are multiple functions in this file, the execution flow can be represented as follows:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note: The execution flow chart shows the possible paths of execution when the `calculator.py` file is run directly. However, in the context of a Python script, the functions `add`, `sub`, and `mul` would typically be called from a main block or other functions, and the execution flow would depend on the specific logic of the script. 

No module-level code, classes, or variables were found in this file.
