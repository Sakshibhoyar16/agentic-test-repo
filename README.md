## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a collection of mathematical functions that can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### add(a, b)
#### Description
The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be added.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be added.
#### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.
#### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### sub(c, d)
#### Description
The `sub` function calculates the difference between two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to be subtracted from the first.
#### Returns
The difference between `c` and `d`.
#### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

### mul(a, b)
#### Description
The `mul` function calculates the product of two numbers.
#### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be multiplied.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be multiplied.
#### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.
#### Example
```python
result = mul(7, 2)
print(result)  # Output: 14
```

Since there are multiple functions in this file, the execution flow can be represented as follows:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
When run directly, this script does not have a main block or any module-level code that performs a specific task. It is designed to be used as a module, importing the functions as needed.
