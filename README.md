## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a collection of mathematical functions that can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Functions
#### add(a, b)
##### Description
The `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to add.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to add.
##### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The sum of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

#### sub(c, d)
##### Description
The `sub` function takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.
##### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to subtract from the first.
##### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The difference between `c` and `d`.
##### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

#### mul(a, b)
##### Description
The `mul` function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to multiply.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to multiply.
##### Returns
* `int` or `float`: The product of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = mul(5, 6)
print(result)  # Output: 30
```

### Execution Flow
Since there are multiple functions in this file, here is a high-level overview of the execution flow:
```mermaid
   flowchart TD
       A[Start] --> B[add]
       A --> C[sub]
       A --> D[mul]
       B --> E[End]
       C --> E
       D --> E
```
Note that the actual execution flow will depend on how these functions are called and used in the larger program.

### Module-Level Code
When run directly, this script does not have any specific behavior, as it only contains function definitions. To use these functions, you would need to import this module into another script and call the functions as needed.
