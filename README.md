## calculator.py
The calculator.py file contains a set of mathematical functions that can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Functions
#### add(a, b)
##### Description
The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be added.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be added.
##### Returns
The sum of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

#### sub(c, d)
##### Description
The `sub` function calculates the difference between two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `c` (int or float): The first number.
* `d` (int or float): The second number to be subtracted from the first.
##### Returns
The difference between `c` and `d`.
##### Example
```python
result = sub(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

#### mul(a, b)
##### Description
The `mul` function calculates the product of two numbers.
##### Parameters
* `a` (int or float): The first number to be multiplied.
* `b` (int or float): The second number to be multiplied.
##### Returns
The product of `a` and `b`.
##### Example
```python
result = mul(5, 6)
print(result)  # Output: 30
```

Since there are multiple functions in this file, here is a flowchart showing the execution flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[add]
    A --> C[sub]
    A --> D[mul]
    B --> E[End]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```
Note that the flowchart assumes that each function can be called independently, and the execution flow may vary depending on the specific use case. 

There are no classes or variables defined in this file. 

When run directly, this script does not have a main block or any module-level code, so there is no specific behavior to describe.
